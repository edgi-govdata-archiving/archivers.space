# ESLint/Vim integration

kmcculloch does all of his coding in vim, and like all good vim nerds he has [posted his configuration on github](https://github.com/kmcculloch/myvim). If that's tl;dr for you, just take a look at the [scrooloose/syntastic](https://github.com/vim-syntastic/syntastic) and [mtscout6/syntastic-local-eslint](https://github.com/mtscout6/syntastic-local-eslint.vim) plugins. If you need to tell syntastic to use `eslint` for javascript files, `let g:syntastic_javascript_checkers = ['eslint']` in your .vimrc should do the trick. For syntax checking, a combination of [pangloss/vim-javascript](https://github.com/pangloss/vim-javascript) and [mxw/vim-jsx](https://github.com/mxw/vim-jsx) works nicely for this project. At the moment all of our .jsx files have a .js extension, so you'll want to use `let g:jsx_ext_required = 0` in your .vimrc so that vim-jsx picks them up.
